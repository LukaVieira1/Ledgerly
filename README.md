This is a simple project to manage sales and payments for a store.

This project was made for my mother's store, but I decided to open source it and make a example store to set a demo for my portfolio.

You can see the live demo [here]() //coming soon.

Example users:

- Owner: owner@example.com / owner123
- Manager: manager@example.com / manager123
- Employee: employee@example.com / employee123
